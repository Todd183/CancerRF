Cancer risk factors analysis in New Zealand


This project analyzes the correlation between cancer incidence rates and associated risk factors by wrangling data on cancer incidence in New Zealand and relevant risk factors.


R Language Dependencies

R dependencies are specified in renv/activate.R, including the required packages and their versions. It will run automatically when use Rstudio to open the R project, as set in CancerRF.Rproj. To replicate this project, run this file to ensure the correct package versions are installed.
tools.R contains functions essential for the project. Before running the notebooks, execute tools.R to load the necessary functions.


Reproduction Instructions

To reproduce this project:
1.	Run renv/activate.R to install R dependencies.
2.	Run the notebooks in the specified order: 1.1, 1.2, 2, 3.1, and 3.2.
3.	Some function will be loaed from R files. If you want to know about details, R files in tools is helpful.

Project Components

Data Wrangling:
`1.1 Data_wrangling_Julia.ipynb`: Julia notebook for preprocessing and cleaning cancer-related datasets.
1.2 Data wrangling-Risk Factors-R.ipynb: R notebook for recoding, reshaping, and summarizing risk factor data, followed by joining with cancer-related datasets.

Statistical Analysis and Correlation Analysis:
`2. Cancer overview analysis-R.ipynb`: R notebook for statistical analysis and visualization of the processed data.
`3.1 Correlation analysis and visualization_R.ipynb`: R notebook for correlation analysis and visualization.
`3.2 Visualization_Julia.ipynb`: Julia notebook for overall visualization of additional

Reporting:
`4. Reports.pdf`: PDF version of the report, consisting of background, method, results, discussion. This file is generated by `4. Reports.Rmd`, and rendering configurations are in the `reference` folder,.

Diary: 
`7.-Project-Diary.pdf`:PDF version of the diary, generated by `7. Project Diary.Rmd`

Data:  
The data folder includes all the outputs of this project. The first part, 'clean,' consists of the results of cleaning the data through data wrangling, while the other part, 'correlation_result,' contains the results of our correlation analysis.
