   abstract = {<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, being the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the world. Several environmental and habitual factors have been associated with the CRC risk. Alcohol intake, a common and rising habit of modern society, is one of the major risk factors for development of CRC. Here, we will summarize the evidence linking alcohol with colon carcinogenesis and possible underlying mechanisms. Some epidemiologic studies suggest that even moderate drinking increases the CRC risk. Metabolism of alcohol involves ethanol conversion to its metabolites that could exert carcinogenic effects in the colon. Production of ethanol metabolites can be affected by the colon microbiota, another recently recognized mediating factor to colon carcinogenesis. The generation of acetaldehyde and alcohol’s other metabolites leads to activation of cancer promoting cascades, such as DNA-adduct formation, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, epigenetic alterations, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and immune modulatory effects. Not only does alcohol induce its toxic effect through carcinogenic metabolites, but alcoholics themselves are predisposed to a poor diet, low in folate and fiber, and circadian disruption, which could further augment alcohol-induced colon carcinogenesis.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> The roles of ambient fine particulate matter (PM <sub>2.5</sub> ) in the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been scarcely highlighted as there is short of empirical evidence regarding the influences of PM <sub>2.5</sub> on multistep carcinogenic processes of CRC. A retrospective cohort design with multistate outcomes was envisaged by linking monthly average PM <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations at 22 city/county level with large-scale cohorts of cancer-screened population to study the influences of PM <sub>2.5</sub> on short-term inflammatory process and multistep carcinogenic processes of CRC. Our study included a nationwide CRC screening cohort of 4,628,995 aged 50–69 years who attended first screen between 2004 and 2009 and continued periodical screens until 2016. We aimed to illustrate the carcinogenesis of PM <sub>2.5</sub> related to CRC by applying both hierarchical logistical and multistate Markov regression models to estimate the effects of air pollution on fecal immunochemical test (FIT) positive (a proxy of inflammatory marker) and pre-clinical and clinical states of CRC in the nationwide cohort. We found a significant association of high PM <sub>2.5</sub> exposure and FIT-positive by an increased risk of 11% [95% confidence interval (CI), 10–12]. PM <sub>2.5</sub> enhanced the risk of being preclinical state by 14% (95% CI, 10–18) and that of subsequent progression from pre-clinical to clinical state by 21% (95% CI, 14–28). Furthermore, the elevated risks for CRC carcinogenesis were significantly higher for people living in high PM <sub>2.5</sub> pollution areas in terms of yearly averages and the number days above 35 µg/m <sup>3</sup> than those living in low PM <sub>2.5</sub> pollution areas. We concluded that both short-term and long-term PM <sub>2.5</sub> exposure were associated with multistep progression of CRC, which were useful to design precision primary and secondary prevention strategies of CRC for people who are exposed to high PM <sub>2.5</sub> pollution. </p>},
